== 1.0.0

* Birthday!

== 1.0.1

* Adding flush method to streams.

== 1.0.2

* Flush the underlying stream too.

== 1.0.3

* Fixed treatment of nils and blank strings. Nils should be written as blank entries while
  blank strings should be wrapped in quotes so YAML parsers know to return a blank string
  instead of a nil. Eg. foo: should parse as {"foo":nil} while foo: "" should parse as
  {"foo":""}.

== 1.0.4

* Mapping values are now wrapped in double quotes by default

== 2.0.0

* Scalars are now dumped more consistently. Strings always have quotes, numbers never do.
  This should address discrepancies that arise when dumping a string of digits. Previously,
  the string would have been dumped either with "non-specific" tag notation (i.e. "!") or
  without quotes. Both result in an integer when parsed. Now if you want to dump a number
  as a string, convert it to a string before serializing.

== 2.0.1

* Quote numeric string keys.
