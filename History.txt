== 1.0.0

* Birthday!

== 1.0.1

* Adding flush method to streams.

== 1.0.2

* Flush the underlying stream too.

== 1.0.3

* Fixed treatment of nils and blank strings. Nils should be written as blank entries while
  blank strings should be wrapped in quotes so YAML parsers know to return a blank string
  instead of a nil. Eg. foo: should parse as {"foo":nil} while foo: "" should parse as
  {"foo":""}.
